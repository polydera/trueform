**trueform** is organized into focused modules, each providing tools for a specific aspect of geometric processing. The library is header-only—include what you need and start coding.

## File Organization

Include everything with a single header:

```cpp
#include <trueform/trueform.hpp>
```

Or include only the modules you need:

```cpp
#include <trueform/spatial.hpp>
#include <trueform/topology.hpp>
```

Each function and class lives in its own header file. This enables fine-grained includes when compile time matters:

```cpp
#include <trueform/spatial/aabb_tree.hpp>
#include <trueform/spatial/distance.hpp>
```

Aggregate headers list everything a module offers. For example, `trueform/spatial.hpp` includes all spatial functionality—read it to see what's available.

## Namespace

All public API is in the `tf::` namespace:

```cpp
tf::point<float, 3> p{1, 2, 3};
tf::aabb_tree<int, float, 3> tree;
auto mesh = tf::read_stl("model.stl");
```

Internal namespaces like `tf::core::`, `tf::topology::` etc. are implementation details. Using them directly is undefined behavior—they may change without notice.

## Modules

Each module page documents its API with working code snippets.
