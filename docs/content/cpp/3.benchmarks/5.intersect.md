Benchmarks for geometric intersection computations. See [experimental setup](/cpp/benchmarks#experimental-setup) for methodology.

## Isocontours

Extraction of isocontours from a scalar field defined on mesh vertices. The scalar field is Euclidean distance from the mesh centroid; isovalues are evenly spaced across the field range. TrueForm uses `tf::make_isocontours` with reduction diagrams in float precision; VTK uses `vtkContourFilter`; libigl uses `igl::isolines`. Results shown for 16 isovalues.

TrueForm isocontour extraction is 40× faster than VTK and 154× faster than libigl at 1M polygons.

## Mesh–Mesh Curves

Intersection curves between two overlapping meshes. The second mesh is a rotated copy around the mesh centroid, using the smallest bounding box axis. TrueForm uses `tf::make_intersection_curves` with reduction diagrams in double precision; CGAL uses `surface_intersection` with `Simple_cartesian<double>` kernel.
