Benchmarks for mesh connectivity analysis. See [experimental setup](/cpp/benchmarks#experimental-setup) for methodology.

## Connected Components

Labeling of face-connected components. Topology is computed from scratch for each run. TrueForm uses `tf::make_manifold_edge_connected_component_labels` with parallel union-find; VTK uses `vtkPolyDataConnectivityFilter`; CGAL uses `connected_components`; libigl uses `igl::facet_components`.

Source: [TrueForm](https://github.com/polydera/trueform/blob/main/benchmarks/topology/connected_components-tf-impl.cpp), [VTK](https://github.com/polydera/trueform/blob/main/benchmarks/topology/connected_components-vtk-impl.cpp), [CGAL](https://github.com/polydera/trueform/blob/main/benchmarks/topology/connected_components-cgal-impl.cpp), [libigl](https://github.com/polydera/trueform/blob/main/benchmarks/topology/connected_components-igl-impl.cpp)

TrueForm connected component labeling is 10× faster than CGAL, 16× faster than libigl, and 5× faster than VTK at 1M polygons.

## Boundary Paths

Extraction of boundary edges organized into connected paths. Topology is computed from scratch for each run. TrueForm uses `tf::make_boundary_paths` with Hierholzer's algorithm; VTK uses `vtkFeatureEdges`; CGAL uses `extract_boundary_cycles`; libigl uses `igl::boundary_loop`.

TrueForm boundary path extraction is 11× faster than CGAL, 9× faster than libigl, and 14× faster than VTK at 1M polygons.
