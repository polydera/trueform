Benchmarks for geometric property computation. See [experimental setup](/cpp/benchmarks#experimental-setup) for methodology.

## ICP Registration

Iterative Closest Point (ICP) mesh registration aligning a source mesh to a target mesh. The target is created by applying 200 iterations of Taubin smoothing to the original mesh. The source is the original mesh rotated by random angles (±10° on each axis) and center-aligned to the target. All libraries use identical parameters: 30 ICP iterations, 1000 subsampled points per iteration, and no early stopping. Times are averaged over 1000 runs with different random rotations. All three libraries produce identical chamfer errors, confirming equivalent registration quality.

TrueForm uses `tf::fit_icp_alignment` with an AABB tree built on target points for O(log n) nearest neighbor queries and random subsampling per iteration. libigl uses `igl::iterative_closest_point` with stochastic surface sampling. VTK uses `vtkIterativeClosestPointTransform` with landmark-based sampling.

TrueForm ICP registration is 40× faster than VTK and 93× faster than libigl at 1M polygons. TrueForm's random subsampling maintains nearly constant time regardless of mesh size, while other libraries scale linearly.

## Principal Curvatures

Computation of principal curvature values and directions at each vertex. Topology is computed from scratch for each run. Both libraries use quadric fitting on k-ring neighborhoods with k=2. TrueForm uses `tf::compute_principal_curvatures` with parallel k-ring traversal; libigl uses `igl::principal_curvature` with sequential processing.

::note{icon="i-lucide-info"}
The benchmark meshes contain non-manifold geometry, which `igl::principal_curvature` does not support. To ensure a fair comparison, both libraries are tested on generated sphere meshes sized to match each input mesh's polygon count.

TrueForm principal curvature computation is 55× faster than libigl at 1M polygons.

## Point Normals

Computation of vertex normals by averaging adjacent face normals. Topology is computed from scratch for each run. TrueForm uses `tf::compute_point_normals` with parallel face membership traversal; libigl uses `igl::per_vertex_normals` with area weighting; VTK uses `vtkPolyDataNormals` with consistency checking and splitting disabled.
