Benchmarks for geometric property computation. See [experimental setup](/cpp/benchmarks#experimental-setup) for methodology.

## Principal Curvatures

Computation of principal curvature values and directions at each vertex. Topology is computed from scratch for each run. Both libraries use quadric fitting on k-ring neighborhoods with k=2. TrueForm uses `tf::compute_principal_curvatures` with parallel k-ring traversal; libigl uses `igl::principal_curvature` with sequential processing.

::note{icon="i-lucide-info"}
The benchmark meshes contain non-manifold geometry, which `igl::principal_curvature` does not support. To ensure a fair comparison, both libraries are tested on generated sphere meshes sized to match each input mesh's polygon count.

TrueForm principal curvature computation is 55× faster than libigl at 1M polygons.

## Point Normals

Computation of vertex normals by averaging adjacent face normals. Topology is computed from scratch for each run. TrueForm uses `tf::compute_point_normals` with parallel face membership traversal; libigl uses `igl::per_vertex_normals` with area weighting; VTK uses `vtkPolyDataNormals` with consistency checking and splitting disabled.
