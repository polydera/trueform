Benchmarks for mesh cutting operations. See [experimental setup](/cpp/benchmarks#experimental-setup) for methodology.

## Boolean

Boolean union of two overlapping meshes. The second mesh is a rotated copy around the mesh centroid, using the smallest bounding box axis. TrueForm uses `tf::make_boolean` with reduction diagrams in double precision; topology structures are precomputed to match CGAL's `Surface_mesh` which includes built-in topological representation. CGAL uses `corefine_and_compute_union` with `Simple_cartesian<double>` kernel; libigl uses `igl::copyleft::cgal::mesh_boolean` with exact predicates (EPECK).

TrueForm boolean union is 84× faster than CGAL and 278× faster than libigl at 1M polygons per mesh, completing in 28ms.

## Self-Intersection

Detection and embedding of self-intersection curves. Two copies of the mesh are concatenated into a single mesh; the second copy is rotated around the mesh centroid, using the smallest bounding box axis. TrueForm uses `tf::embedded_self_intersection_curves` with reduction diagrams in double precision; no structures are precomputed to match libigl which also builds everything from raw input. libigl uses `igl::copyleft::cgal::remesh_self_intersections` with exact predicates (EPECK).

TrueForm self-intersection detection and embedding is 32× faster than libigl at 1M polygons per mesh.

## Embedded Isocurves

Embedding of isocontours into mesh topology by splitting faces along level-set curves. The scalar field is Euclidean distance from the mesh centroid; isovalues are evenly spaced across the field range. TrueForm uses `tf::embedded_isocurves` with reduction diagrams in float precision; VTK uses `vtkBandedPolyDataContourFilter`. Results shown for 16 isovalues.

TrueForm embedded isocurve extraction is 33× faster than VTK at 1M polygons.
