TrueForm enables real-time geometric operations on million-polygon meshes. On a pair of 1M-polygon meshes, boolean union completes in 28ms and intersection curve extraction in 7ms. [Try it live in your browser →](/live-examples/boolean)

These benchmarks quantify performance against established libraries across spatial indexing, topology analysis, intersection computation, and mesh cutting.

## Experimental Setup

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| CPU | Apple M4 Max (12P + 4E cores) |
| Memory | 64 GB |
| Compiler | Clang with `-O3 -march=native` |
| Allocator | [mimalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc) |
| Test Data | [Stanford Dragon](https://github.com/polydera/trueform/tree/main/benchmarks/data), 58K–1M polygons (contains non-manifold flaps) |
| Sampling | 10–1000 evaluations per configuration |
| Baselines | Fastest available configuration that achieves correct results |

Construction benchmarks use 10 runs; query benchmarks use 1000. All libraries use parallel execution where available. For sub-millisecond queries, mean time is reported; for longer operations, minimum time is reported to reduce noise from OS scheduling.

## Summary

| Mesh–Mesh Distance | 2 × 1M | 0.2 ms | **2×** | Coal (FCL) `OBBRSS` | OBBRSS tree |
| Principal Curvatures | 1M | 25 ms | **55×** | libigl | parallel k-ring quadric fitting |

## Running Benchmarks

### Dependencies

::code-group
```bash [macOS]
brew install boost gmp mpfr libccd tbb assimp libomp
```
```bash [Linux]
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libccd-dev libtbb-dev libassimp-dev libomp-dev
```
```powershell [Windows]
vcpkg install boost gmp mpfr libccd tbb assimp llvm-openmp
```

### Comparison Libraries

CGAL, libigl, FCL, Coal, and nanoflann are fetched automatically via CMake FetchContent.

VTK is optional due to its size. Install it separately to include VTK benchmarks; otherwise they are skipped.

::code-group
```bash [macOS]
brew install vtk
```
```bash [Linux]
sudo apt-get install libvtk9-dev
```
```powershell [Windows]
vcpkg install vtk
```
::

### Build and Run

```bash
cmake -B build -DTF_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel --target benchmarks
./build/run-benchmarks
```

Results are written to `build/results/`. Use `consolidate_results.py` to merge per-library CSVs.
