Try trueform without installing anything. The [live examples](/live-examples/boolean) run booleans, mesh registration, isobands, and more in your browser.

Complete workflows demonstrating trueform in practice — from basic mesh operations to advanced alignment pipelines. For examples of specific functions, see the module documentation — each section includes working code snippets.

## Building

Examples are in the [examples/](https://github.com/polydera/trueform/tree/main/examples) directory.

```bash
cmake -B build -DTF_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
cmake --build build --parallel --target trueform_examples
```

## Interactive VTK Examples

The VTK integration includes interactive applications — spatial queries, booleans, scalar fields, topology — with draggable meshes and real-time updates.
