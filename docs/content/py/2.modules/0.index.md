**trueform** is organized into focused modules, each providing tools for a specific aspect of geometric processing.

## Import

All functionality is accessible through a single import:

```python
import trueform as tf

point = tf.Point([1, 2, 3])
mesh = tf.Mesh(faces, points)
result = tf.read_stl("model.stl")
```

## Modules

Each module page documents its API with working code snippets.
