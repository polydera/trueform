Geometry pipelines accumulate defects. Sculpting, remeshing, format conversion—each step can introduce non-manifold flaps, inconsistencies, and surface artifacts. By the time geometry reaches your algorithm, it is rarely the ideal manifold most methods assume.

`trueform` is built around a simple idea: **a mesh should be understood as an intended surface, observed through the noise of floating-point arithmetic and prior processing.**

These defects are additive—they attach to the surface without creating holes. The underlying structure remains recoverable.

This perspective shapes the algorithms:

- **Topological consistency.** The intersection graph is reduced to its unique canonical form. The reduction diagram maps each intersection to its simplest representative in the ε-topology, ensuring consistency under floating-point uncertainty.

- **Artifacts are modeled as independent noise.** Geometric inconsistencies decompose locally across polygon regions; topological artifacts decompose globally across manifold edge-connected components—enabling robust classification of the intended structure.

The goal is **commutative correctness**: operations that commute with mesh idealization. Chain operations freely on non-ideal meshes and clean up once at the end.
