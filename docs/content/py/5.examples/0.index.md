Try trueform without installing anything. The [live examples](/live-examples/boolean) run booleans, mesh registration, isobands, and more in your browser.

## Running the Examples

```bash
pip install trueform
git clone https://github.com/polydera/trueform.git
cd trueform/python/examples
```

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [alignment.py](https://github.com/polydera/trueform/blob/main/python/examples/alignment.py) | Point cloud alignment with rigid, OBB, and ICP |

## Interactive VTK Examples

The `vtk/` directory contains interactive applications. Each opens a window where you can drag meshes and see results update in real time.

```bash
pip install vtk
```

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [alignment.py](https://github.com/polydera/trueform/blob/main/python/examples/vtk/alignment.py) | Interactive mesh registration with OBB + ICP |
| [collision.py](https://github.com/polydera/trueform/blob/main/python/examples/vtk/collision.py) | 5×5 grid of meshes — hover to highlight, drag to move, collisions turn cyan |
| [boolean_difference.py](https://github.com/polydera/trueform/blob/main/python/examples/vtk/boolean_difference.py) | Dual viewport showing inputs and boolean result |
| [cross_section.py](https://github.com/polydera/trueform/blob/main/python/examples/vtk/cross_section.py) | Cutting plane with filled cross-section polygons |
| [intersection_curves.py](https://github.com/polydera/trueform/blob/main/python/examples/vtk/intersection_curves.py) | Real-time mesh-mesh intersection curves |
| [isobands.py](https://github.com/polydera/trueform/blob/main/python/examples/vtk/isobands.py) | Extract regions between scalar thresholds |
| [isocontours.py](https://github.com/polydera/trueform/blob/main/python/examples/vtk/isocontours.py) | Extract contour curves at scalar thresholds |
