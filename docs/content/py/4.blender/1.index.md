The `trueform.bpy` module integrates trueform with Blender. It provides conversion utilities for standalone scripts and a scene module with caching for add-ons with live preview.

## Installation

The Blender add-on bundles trueform, the `trueform.bpy` integration module, and an example Boolean plugin with live preview.

### Pre-built (Recommended)

Download the latest release for your platform from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/polydera/trueform/releases) page:
- `trueform-bpy-plugin-windows-py311.zip` — Windows (64-bit)
- `trueform-bpy-plugin-macos-arm64-py311.zip` — macOS (Apple Silicon)
- `trueform-bpy-plugin-linux-py311.zip` — Linux (64-bit)

Install in Blender:
1. Edit → Preferences → Add-ons
2. Click "Install..." and select the downloaded zip
3. Enable "Trueform Boolean" from the list

### From Source

Building from source requires a Python version matching Blender's embedded Python (e.g., Python 3.11 for Blender 4.2+).

```bash
# Use Python 3.11 (must match Blender's Python)
pip install .

# Package the add-on
python python/tools/package_blender_plugin.py \
    --plugin-init python/examples/bpy-plugin/__init__.py \
    --output trueform-bpy-plugin.zip
```

Then install `trueform-bpy-plugin.zip` in Blender as above.

## Quick Tour

### Standalone Scripts

For scripts that process meshes without live preview, use `tbpy.convert` to convert between formats and call trueform functions directly:

```python
import trueform as tf
from trueform import bpy as tbpy

# Convert Blender meshes to trueform
mesh_a = tbpy.convert.from_blender(obj_a)
mesh_b = tbpy.convert.from_blender(obj_b)

# Boolean difference - returns (faces, points) tuple and labels array
# labels indicates which input mesh (0 or 1) each face originated from
(result_faces, result_points), labels = tf.boolean_difference(mesh_a, mesh_b)

# Optionally get intersection curves
(result_faces, result_points), labels, (paths, curve_points) = tf.boolean_difference(
    mesh_a, mesh_b, return_curves=True
)

# Create result mesh and convert back to Blender
result = tf.Mesh(result_faces, result_points)
new_obj = tbpy.convert.to_blender(result, name="Result")

# Optionally create curves object
curves_obj = tbpy.convert.to_blender_curves(paths, curve_points, name="Curves")
```

### Add-ons with Live Preview

For add-ons that need cached meshes with automatic updates, use `tbpy.scene`:

```python
from trueform import bpy as tbpy

def register():
    tbpy.register()  # Register scene handlers

def unregister():
    tbpy.unregister()  # Clean up handlers

# In operator/handler - uses cached meshes with world transforms
result_obj = tbpy.scene.boolean_difference(obj_a, obj_b, name="Result")

# Or with intersection curves
result_obj, curves_obj = tbpy.scene.boolean_union(obj_a, obj_b, return_curves=True)

# Low-level access to cached mesh
mesh = tbpy.scene.get(obj)  # tf.Mesh with world transform applied
```

The scene module:
- Caches `tf.Mesh` instances per mesh datablock
- Automatically tracks geometry changes via depsgraph
- Rebuilds structures lazily on access (not on every change)
- Only works for objects linked to the active scene/view layer
