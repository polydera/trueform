TrueForm enables real-time geometric operations on million-polygon meshes. On a pair of 1M-polygon meshes, boolean union completes in 28ms and intersection curve extraction in 7ms. [Try it live in your browser →](/live-examples/boolean)

The Python bindings use the same C++ core, so performance characteristics are identical. See the [C++ benchmarks](/cpp/benchmarks) for experimental setup, detailed charts, and scaling analysis.

## Summary

Sample comparisons against VTK, CGAL, libigl, Coal, FCL, and nanoflann:

| Operation | Input | Time | Speedup | Baseline | TrueForm |
|-----------|-------|------|---------|----------|----------|
| Boolean Union | 2 × 1M | 28 ms | **84×** | CGAL `Simple_cartesian<double>` | reduction diagrams, double |
| Mesh–Mesh Curves | 2 × 1M | 7 ms | **233×** | CGAL `Simple_cartesian<double>` | reduction diagrams, double |
| Self-Intersection | 1M | 78 ms | **37×** | libigl EPECK (GMP/MPFR) | reduction diagrams, double |
| Isocontours | 1M, 16 cuts | 3.8 ms | **38×** | VTK `vtkContourFilter` | reduction diagrams, float |
| Connected Components | 1M | 15 ms | **10×** | CGAL | parallel union-find |
| Boundary Paths | 1M | 12 ms | **11×** | CGAL | Hierholzer's algorithm |
| k-NN Query | 500K | 1.7 µs | **3×** | nanoflann k-d tree | AABB tree |
| Mesh–Mesh Distance | 2 × 1M | 0.2 ms | **2×** | Coal (FCL) `OBBRSS` | OBBRSS tree |
| Principal Curvatures | 1M | 25 ms | **55×** | libigl | parallel k-ring quadric fitting |
