# Commercial Licensing

trueform is available for evaluation, personal, and educational work under the PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0. Any revenue-generating, production, or for-profit deployment requires a commercial agreement with XLAB.

## What a Commercial License Provides
- Rights to use trueform in commercial and production environments.
- Access to priority support and roadmap discussions.
- Optional professional services and training packages.

Pricing is tailored to your organization (team size, deployment model, and support requirements).
